Impulse based *physics engine project*. A learning project for an introductory masters level course in Game Physics FYSM513. Intended use case is academical and fair; lets keep it that way.

Learning material is the Ian Millingtons Game Engine physics book. Intent is to organize this repository into a hopefully modular and reusable piece of code for further exploration based on the learnings from the book.

Is public mainly because it is easier for all parties involved (ie for evaluation). Will contain some commenting in finnish(my mother tongue) so be advised when trying to unpack the code should you choose to look at it in more detail.

For your learning journey, I recommend the original book and the source code which is a google search away, you will enjoy it more.
