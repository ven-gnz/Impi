\#Impi



Impulse based physics engine. A learning project for an introductory masters level course in Game Physics FYSM513.
Intended use case is academical and fair; lets keep it that way.



Learning material is the Ian Millingtons Game Engine physics book. Intent is to organize this repository into a hopefully modular

and reusable piece of code for further exploration based on the learnings from the book.


Is public mainly because it is easier for all parties involved. Will contain some commenting in finnish so be advised when trying to

unpack the code should you choose to look at it in more detail.

For your learning journey, I recommend the original book and the source code which is a google search away.
