# Impi

Impulse based *physics engine project*. A learning project for an introductory masters level course in Game Physics FYSM513. Intended use case is academical and fair; lets keep it that way.

Learning material is the Ian Millingtons Game Engine physics book. Intent is to organize this repository into a hopefully modular and reusable piece of code for further exploration based on the learnings from the book.

Is public mainly because it is easier for all parties involved (ie for evaluation). Will contain some commenting in finnish(my mother tongue) so be advised when trying to unpack the code should you choose to look at it in more detail.

For your learning journey, I recommend the original book and the source code which is a google search away, you will enjoy it more.

## Status

Currently, or as of mid december, the project is in hiatus. It taught me good fund
amentals in physical modelling. I got to about 330-ish pages during the course on the Millingtons book, and with that the collision detection and resolution for rigid bodies, as done in the box test scene.

## Upcoming plans

Next for Impi, I am looking forwards to finishing the book, leading to some **optimizations** and **acceleration structures**, and a task system/threading system to speed up and possibly stress test with a relatively big n-count of boxes.

Another goal, is **re-organizing the codebase**, for using Impi as a modular library once its a bit more feature-complete. Particularly, I am interested in linking my physics engine with my up and coming animation library, Ankka.

If I have time, I will also finish (or get properly started with) the fluid simulation scene. But this is least prioritized for the time being.
